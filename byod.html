  <p>For this project I was given a PSD by a designer and tasked with making it into a custom WordPress theme that could be managed by an internal team. I was able to create the theme from the PSD and give the client a website they are really proud of.</p>

          "Our client had a new website that needed to relay quite a bit of information in a small area, which meant some clever design and development thinking. West not only delivered rock-solid custom development, but contributed ideas and suggestions that brought the website to life. His partnership on dozens of projects like this has been instrumental to my business."
