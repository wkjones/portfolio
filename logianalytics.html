  <p>Logi Analytics is one of my favorite clients to date. I was tasked with taking their current WordPress theme and building out some custom areas. I used their existing architecture, and working with a designer, we added some new features and layouts to the site.</p>

        "After wasting time on a string of disappointing web agencies and freelance developers, I hit the jackpot with West.  Logi constantly iterates and improves its website, and West is our secret weapon—proactive, creative, astonishingly fast, a savvy developer, and unfailingly detail-oriented.  He’s an essential—and rock solid—part of our team."
